I have devided the update 4.3 into 2 parts due to amount of incomplete tasks and long absence of updates. This patch contains most of new features and fixes from the upcoming update. Major changes to player customization system and the addition of accessories are left for 4.3. I've kinda gone overboard with plans for this year, so don't expect 4.3 out very soon.
